# Steps 

*after installing all apps*

**Step One** *update & upgrade termux > **apt upgrade -y** & **apt update -y** ( each command is alone not in the same line )*

**Step Two** *open your andronix and choose your preferred type of Linux dist ( choose install ) will copy the download link as a command )*

**Step Three** *open termux app and past the command and press Enter . will download the dist . during installtion will ask you about your language and password .*

**Step Four** *after the installtion is done . you need to open your dist but how!? 
write **ls** command to display the files where you are on . go to download directory **cd download** display the files in this directory **ls**
in my android i have installed ubuntu . in your case you wil find your dist ended with **.sh** . how to excute this file!? with **bash** command 
For Example **bash start-ubuntu.sh** will open Linux dist as cli . you can write linux commands and do what you would like to do such as you have linux.*

**Step Five** *now we have linux as command line interface . but we want to open it as Gui . do not be impress! we will get linux as Gui with **VNC**
open VNC app . press the **+** sign . you will be asked for IP Adress:Port  and the name of your computer.
**IP Adress** will be the loopback address **127.0.0.1:1** The port will be **1**
**the name** Write any name you like 
after you answer you will be asked too for password of this dist . remember the password that you have enterd during the installtion .*

# The installation is successfully Done .

# note 

*no one has spoken about the issue after while of installation . issues such as **connection error about the port** do not worry 
It is simple this issue because of vnc server need to be reopening . But how!?
open your dist as cli **bash start-ubuntu.sh** 
Write **vncserver-stop** will kill vnc process and write **vncserver-start** will start vnc process. That's it ðŸ˜œ 
Go to vnc and try again will open . 



Anthor issue with password forgotten . Go to your dist as cli and write **vncpasswd** you will be asked to Assign new password .*
